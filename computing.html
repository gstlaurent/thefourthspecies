		<h2>Snake</h2>

		<p>
			This whole site was originally conceived as a way to help me learn
			about web programming. I figured that it was high-time I learned
			about html and css and JavaScript and things, especially since my
			friends had already been playing with websites in the nineties. But,
			once I realized that basic html and css is pretty straightforward,
			and seeing that manipulating a website becomes pretty intuitive when
			augmenting JavaScript with something like jQuery, I decided I had to
			do something at least a <em>little</em> more complex. (That was an <em>emphasis</em>
			on the 'little', in case it wasn't clear.) And what could be simpler
			than Snake?
		</p>
		<p>
			This version of Snake came from my memory. It was one of the first
			computer games I ever played, after all. (<a
				href="http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-st-breakout_8809.html">Breakout</a>
			was another. Incidentally, the version I link to has a date of 1992
			on it, but it looks a lot like the 1985 version I remember.). It was
			on an old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn_Atom">Acorn
				Atom</a> and I remember it being so old-fashioned that it only had greys
			and browns for colours. I remember it being smooth and fun, with
			random numbers popping up everywhere, and my mom said she saw a snake
			so big once it filled the whole screen. (Be warned, as of yet, if you
			fill the screen in my version, there is no congratulatory screen; you
			merely die). This was so much fun that I altered the code to Nibbles
			on my old Windows machine (in QBasic) so that I could play a version
			all on one screen (at a ridiculous speed too, if I recall correctly).
			Anyway, this was one of the first games I ever tried to recreate; and
			somehow, the thirteen-year-old version of me failed to complete it.
			Twenty-years later, I finally succeed.
		</p>
		<p>
			(By the way, when doing a little research for this old game, I came
			across a few <a
				href="http://bgrandovec.hostzi.com/Thumbs/Acorn_Atom/Snake.png">screenshots</a>
			of the <a
				href="http://gamesdbase.com/Media/SYSTEM/Acorn_Atom/Snap/big/Snake_-_1981_-_Acornsoft.jpg">Acorn
				Atom Version</a> I was <a
				href="http://gamesdbase.com/Media/SYSTEM/Acorn_Atom/Title/big/Snake_-_1981_-_Acornsoft.jpg">remembering</a>.
			As you can see, it certainly is in colour, although I don't know why
			there are two different colour-schemes: my dad remembers the yellow
			and black one. He also pointed out that the reason I remember the
			game all in greys and browns is that we had the old machine hooked up
			to an even older little black and white tv when I was a kid. Oh well.<br>
			Also, note that the "original" lets you choose your speed. I've added
			that feature too, but in a slightly different way (By the way, you sometimes
			die if you try to adjust your speed while not paused. Although unintended, 
			I'm not entirely convinced that's a bug.)
		</p>
		<p>
			This is a slightly-updated version of my Snake game. If you're not quick enough, the food will go away. 
			It is pretty much the same otherwise, except that I removed the animations because I never play it that
			slowly, as it turns out. If you want to play the old version, go <a href="snake1.html">here.</a>.
